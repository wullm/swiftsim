how VELOCIraptor works, the second subsection explains how to configure SWIFT
with VELOCIraptor, the third subsection explains how to configure a standalone
version of VELOCIraptor and the fourth subsection explains how the output format
of VELOCIraptor works. There is an additional fifth section which describes the

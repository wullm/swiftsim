Initial Conditions
==================

Tools for the creation of initial conditions are available via 
the 
`WoMa <https://github.com/srbonilla/WoMa>`_ and 
`SEAGen <https://github.com/jkeger/seagen>`_ open-source python packages, 
including: creating spherical or spinning planetary (or similar) profiles;
placing particles to match arbitrary profiles with precise SPH densities;
and setting the initial target and impactor positions and velocities,
as presented in 
`Kegerreis et al. (2019)  <https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz1606>`_ and
Ruiz-Bonilla et al. (2020).

They are available with documentation and examples at 
https://github.com/srbonilla/WoMa and https://github.com/jkeger/seagen,
or can be installed directly with ``pip``
(https://pypi.org/project/woma/, https://pypi.org/project/seagen/).

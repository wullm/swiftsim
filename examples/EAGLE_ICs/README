This directory contains initial conditions generated for
the EAGLE suite of simulations. The cosmology, resolution
and phases are the same as used in the original suite. The only
difference is the file format, adapted for SWIFT.

Compared to the original EAGLE runs of Schaye et al. 2015),
the following changes have been made:

 - The dark matter softening lengths have been increased to 1.3
   pkpc and 3.32 ckpc. The comoving baryon softening lengths have
   been changed to 1.79 ckpc. This follows the recommendations of
   Ludlow et al. 2019. Old values were 0.7 pkpc and 2.69 ckpc for
   all the particle species.
 - SPH particles with a mass larger than 7*10^6 Msun (~4x the initial
   gas particle mass) are now split into 2 equal mass particles
   within the smoothing length of the original particle.
 - The metallicity-dependent density threshold for star formation
   uses the smoothed metallicities and not the raw metallicities
   any more.
 - The redshift of H reionization has been lowered to 7.5 (from 11.5).
 - The minimal mass of SNII stars has been raised to 8 Msun (from 6).
 - The SNII feedback delay is done by sampling the stellar age
   distribution and not using a fixed delay of 30 Myr any more.
 - The Magnesium yields from SNII stars have been boosted by a
   factor of 2.
 - The delay time distribution of the SNIa has been changed to a
   power-law of slope -1 (instead of the exponential model) and
   the rates have been renormalized.
 - The black hole accretion rate is now limited to 100% of the
   Eddington rate (from 100/h = 150 %).

The scripts in this directory download the tables required to
run the EAGLE model. Plotting scripts are also provided
for basic quantities.

VELOCIraptor can be run on the output. The code is compiled
using

cmake -DVR_USE_GAS=ON -DVR_USE_STAR=ON -DV_USE_BH=ON

and run using

stf -C vrconfig_3dfof_subhalos_SO_hydro.cfg -i eagle_0035 -o halos_0035 -I 2

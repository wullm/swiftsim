Initial conditions corresponding to the 6.25 Mpc volume
of the EAGLE suite. The ICs only contain DM particles. The
gas particles will be generated in SWIFT.

Note that this is a very very small volume. It will not result
in a galaxy population matching the data averaged on large scale.


This resolution corresponds to: EAGLE res (m_B = 1.81e6 Msol)

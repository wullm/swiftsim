This example consists in a uniform box of particles.
Using the cooling and gravity, the temperature of the gas will decrease
slowly and the gas will start to collapse due to the numerical noise.
If a pressure / energy floor is applied, the box should remain uniform.

At the end, a plot containing the distribution of densities is generated.
